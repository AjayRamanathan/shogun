	* SHOGUN Release version 0.6.3
	* This release contains several cleanups and bugfixes:
		- Fail nicely in out of memory situations.
		- Drop R package, now configure; make; make install will work for all
		interfaces.
		- Disable progress output by default. Ocas now uses a progress bar and
		  hence is less verbose.
		- Revised directory structure with /doc, /examples, /src, /testsuite.
		- Add common toy data repository and make all examples from all interfaces
		use it.
		- Add examples for cmdline interface.
		- Dynamically generate a reference documentation for the static interfaces.
		- Syntax highlight commands again.
		- Support for cplex 11.
		- Port MKL examples to R.
		- Merge structure learning branch.
	* Bugfixes:
		- Don't render string if it is not printed in current loglevel anyway
		and throw exceptions for messages with priority ERROR or higher.
		- Compile fix when lapack is not available.
		- Fix when only lapack and blas (but not atlas) are available.
		- Fix bug in batch/linadd occurring for WD kernel of order 1.
		- Check that strings have same length on initing WD kernels.
		- Remove signal handler on Ctrl+C to fix Ctrl+C pressed twice bug.
		- All derived classes now call their parent class on construction.
		- Fix a crasher occuring with SVRLight on multiple threads.

	* SHOGUN Release version 0.6.2
		- Experimental support for r-modular thanks to the swig team!
		- All python-modular examples describing the use of kernels,
		classifier, distributions, features, distances, regression and
		preprocessors have been ported to r-modular (requires swig from svn).
		- The 'send_command' legacy is no longer necessary, numbers can be used
		as such and don't have to be given as strings. All examples for
		r,python,octave,matlab have been converted to the new syntax.
		- Resurrected the command line interface. Basic functionionality,
		like training a classifier on strings/real valued (sparse) features
		was restored. Readline completion was added.
		- Documentation updates.
	* Bugfixes:
		- The weighted spectrum kernel is now working again.
		- Fix the testsuite to reliably check methods that use random().
		- Off-by-one bug fix in FixedDegreeStringKernel.
		- Fix reading strings from file, when strings don't have the same length.
		- Fix massive slowdown in modular interfaces for WD based kernels (it
		is 5-30 times faster now).

2008-04-19  Soeren Sonnenburg <debian@nn7.de>

	* SHOGUN Release version 0.6.1
		- Now fully support octave-modular thanks to the swig team!
		- All python-modular examples describing the use of kernels,
		classifier, distributions, features, distances, regression and
		preprocessors have been ported to octave-modular.
		- Minor documentation updates.
		- Unconditionally disable swig director. This reduces wrapper code size
		and compile time and also speeds up calls to virtual functions *a lot*.
		Expect big speed improvements if you were using the python-modular
		interface.
	* Bugfixes:
		- Include missing files in documentation.
		- The 'send_command' legacy is no longer necessary.
		- Improved cmdline help, categorized in topic sg('help', 'topic')
